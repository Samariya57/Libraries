        <p>The <strong>Admont Abby Library</strong> is located on the <em>Enns River</em> in the town of <em>Abby, Austria </em>. The library was completed in 1776 by 
        by <strong>Graz Master Builder Josef Hueber</strong>.  The total size of the library is 230 ft in length, 46ft in width, 36ft in height and is the largest monastary library in the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The seven ceiling frescoes are also suffused with the spirit of the Enlightenment and were painted by the then 80-year-old <strong>Bartolomeo Altomonte </strong>(1694 â€“ 1783) in the summer months of the years 1775 and 1776. They show the various phases of human understanding; beginning with thought and speech, through the sciences and arts, and finally culminating in Divine Revelation in the central cupola. In the cases below this cupola are stored various editions of the Bible and the works of the Church Fathers, in the side room to the north is theological literature while the books on other subjects are to be found in the southern side room.</p>

            The <strong>Stephen A. Schwarzman Building </strong> is the flagship building of the <strong>New York Public Library</strong> (NYPL) system 
        in New York City. Opened in 1911 and designed by architects Carr√®re and Hastings in the <em>Beaux Arts</em> style, the iconic building is a 
        renowned landmark in Manhattan and one of the most prominent libraries in the United States.

            The Library's famous Rose Main Reading Room is a majestic, high-ceiling room with grand windows and chandeliers, lined with
            thousands of reference works on open shelves. It is also equipped with computers providing access to library collections as well as the Internet.
            There are special rooms named for notable authors and scholars, many of whom have done important research and writing at the Library. 
            But the Library has always been about more than scholars; during the Great Depression, many members of the general public, out of work, used the Library to improve their lot in life, as they still do.

            One of the most iconic monuments of the New York Public Library, as well as New York itself, are the two stone lions made of Tennessee marble that lie at either side 
            of the stairway to the entrance. The famous pair guarding the entrance were sculpted by Edward Clark Potter. Their original names, "Leo Astor" and "Leo Lenox" 
            (in honor of the library's founders) were transformed into Lord Astor and Lady Lenox (although both lions are male), and in the 1930s they were nicknamed "Patience" and "Fortitude"
            by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who chose the names because he felt that the citizens of New York would need to possess these qualities to see themselves through the Great Depression.

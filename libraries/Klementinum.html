        <p>The Clementinum <italic>(Klementinum in Czech)</italic> is a historic complex of buildings in Prague. 
        Until recently the complex hosted the National, University and Technical libraries, the City Library also being 
        located nearby on Mariánské Náměstí. The Technical library and the Municipal library have moved to the Prague 
        National Technical Library at Technická 6 since 2009. It is currently in use as the National Library of the 
        Czech Republic. In 2005, the Czech National Library received the UNESCO Jikji prize (Memory of the World). </p>
        <p>Its history dates from the existence of a chapel dedicated to Saint Clement in the 11th century. A Dominican monastery 
        was founded in the medieval period, which was transformed in 1556 to a Jesuit college. In 1622 the Jesuits transferred the
        library of Charles University to the Klementinum, and the college was merged with the University in 1654. The Jesuits
        remained until 1773, when the Klementinum was established as an observatory, library, and university by the Empress Maria 
        Theresa of Austria. </p>
        <p>The National Library was founded in 1781 and from 1782 the Clementinum was a legal deposit library. 
        In 1918 the newly established Czecho-Slovak state took over the library. Since 1990, it has been the National Library.
        It contains a collection of Mozartiana, material pertaining to Tycho Brahe and Comenius, as well as historic examples
        of Czech literature. The architecture is a notable example of Baroque architecture and Clementinum, covering 20,000 
        square metres, is the second largest complex of buildings in Prague after the Prague Castle. For several years before 
        2006, there was an ongoing debate on the possibilities of expanding the space for future library collections, as space 
        in the current Clementinum buildings was expected to reach its limit by 2010. On Jan 10, 2006, the Prague authorities
        decided to sell the city-owned property located in the area of Letná near the Prague center, to the National Library. 
        In Spring 2006, an international architectural design competition for the new building was put up. An architect who
        won the competition is Jan Kaplický, but his winning was infirmed, so the Czech National Library is still waiting for
        its final project.</p>

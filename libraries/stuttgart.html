         <p>The <strong>Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart </strong> <em>(formerly known as Stadtbücherei Stuttgart)</em> is the public library of the city 
         of Stuttgart, Germany.</p>
        <p>From 1965 to 2011, the Central Library of Stuttgart was located in the Wilhelmspalais in Stuttgart. This building was built 1834 - 1840 by
        Giovanni Salucci. It was the place of residence of King Wilhelm II of the Kingdom of Württemberg. In 2011 the Central library moved to the newly 
        built <em>Stadtbibliothek am Mailänder Platz.</em></p>
        <p>The newly-built Stuttgart public library was designed by Korean architect Eun Young Yi. The style is distinctly modern and polished. 
        Grey and white by day, the library cube glows at night in an iridescent blue. From the outside the building seems closed off, but a 
        new world opens up on entering: a 14-metre-high, empty hall, lit only by one overhead window. 100 sq. m of void to offset the everyday hustle 
        and bustle. </p>
        <p>The Municipal Library has become Stuttgart’s new intellectual and cultural centre that is open to people of every nation. 
        This is also symbolised by the inscriptions on the outer walls: the word "Library" in silver letters is in English on the west wall, 
        in German on the north, in Korean on the East and in Arabic on the south. </p>

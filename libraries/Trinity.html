        <p>The Library of Trinity College Dublin serves Trinity College and the University of Dublin. It is the largest library
        in Ireland and, as a legal deposit or "copyright library", it has rights to receive material published in the Republic 
        of Ireland free of charge; it is also the only Irish library to hold such rights for the United Kingdom. The Library is
        the permanent home to the famous Book of Kells. Two of the four volumes are on public display, one opened to a major
        decorated page and the other to a typical page of text. The volumes and pages shown are regularly changed. Members 
        of the University of Dublin also have access to the libraries of Tallaght Hospital and the Irish School of Ecumenics,
        Milltown. </p>
        <p>The Library began with the founding of Trinity College in 1592. In 1661, Henry Jones presented it with the 
        Book of Kells, its most famous manuscript. James Ussher (1625â€“56), Archbishop of Armagh, whose most important
        works were "Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum Sylloge" (1632) and "Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates"
        (1639), left his valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the Library.
        His complete works were published by the Library in twenty-four volumes. </p>
        <p>In 1801, the Library was given legal deposit rights, making it the only library in Ireland to have such 
        rights for the United Kingdom.[3] Starting at 4 pm on Saturday 29 November 2009, the Trinity Students' Union 
        organized a 24-hour sit-in in protest at a reduced book-buying budget, lack of access to books on Sundays, 
        and a proposed reduction of counter services.</p>
